# Project Rules & Preferences

## Design System

- **Primary Color**: Midnight-green (use for buttons, CTAs, accents, and primary elements)
- **Primary Background**: Black (#000000) - very dark
- **Primary Text**: Cream/light colors for contrast

  - Tablet: 720px - 980px
  - Desktop: > 980px
- **All components must be fully responsive**
- **Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports**

## Code Standards

- CSS custom properties (variables) for colors and spacing
- Modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox, clamp() for responsive sizing)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks unless specified)
- Accessibility: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation
- Performance: Optimize images, minimize CSS/JS, use efficient selectors

## Project Context
